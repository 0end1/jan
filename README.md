## Quickstart

So far, this setup is tested and supported for Docker on Linux, Mac, and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

### Dependencies

- **Install Docker**: Install Docker [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

- **Install Docker Compose**: Install Docker Compose [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

- **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository and pull in the latest git submodules.

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/janhq/jan.git

  cd jan

  # Pull latest submodules
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  ```

- **Export Environment Variables**
```sh
# For Apple Silicon, please set the Docker platform
export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/$(uname -m)
```

- **Set a .env**: You will need to set up several environment variables for services such as Keycloak and Postgres. You can place them in `.env` files in the respective folders as shown in the `docker-compose.yml`.

  ```bash
  cp sample.env .env
  ```

  | Service (Docker)       | env file                                                                                                                        |
  | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | Global env             | `.env`, just run `cp sample.env .env`                                                                                           |
  | Keycloak               | `.env` presented in global env and initiate realm in `conf/keycloak_conf/example-realm.json`                                    |
  | Keycloak PostgresDB    | `.env` presented in global env                                                                                                  |
  | jan-inference          | `.env` presented in global env                                                                                                  |
  | app-backend (hasura)   | `conf/sample.env_app-backend` refer from [here](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/config-examples/) |
  | app-backend PostgresDB | `conf/sample.env_app-backend-postgres`                                                                                          |
  | web-client             | `conf/sample.env_web-client`                                                                                                    |

### Install Models

- Download Runway SD 1.5 from HuggingFace
```sh
wget https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5/resolve/main/v1-5-pruned-emaonly.safetensors -P jan-inference/sd/models
```

-  Download Llama 7Bn ggml from HuggingFace
```sh
wget https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML/resolve/main/llama-2-7b-chat.ggmlv3.q4_1.bin -P jan-inference/llm/models
```

### Compose Up

Jan uses an opinionated, but modular, open-source stack that comes with many services out of the box, e.g. multiple clients, autoscaling, auth and more.

You can opt out of such services or swap in your own integrations via [Configurations](#configurations).

- Run the following command to start all the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml`

```shell
# Docker Compose up
docker compose up

# Docker Compose up detached mode
docker compose up -d
```

- This step takes 5-15 minutes and the following services will be provisioned:

| Service     | URL                   | Credentials                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Keycloak             | http://localhost:8088 | Admin credentials are set via the environment variables `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN` and `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD`                                                               |
| app-backend (hasura) | http://localhost:8080 | Admin credentials are set via the environment variables `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET` in file `conf/sample.env_app-backend`                                          |
| web-client           | http://localhost:3000 | Users are signed up to keycloak, default created user is set via `conf/keycloak_conf/example-realm.json` on keycloak with username: `username`, password: `password` |
| llm service          | http://localhost:8000 |                                                                                                                                                                      |
| sd service          | http://localhost:8001 |                                                                                                                                                                      |

## Usage

- Launch the web application via `http://localhost:3000`.
