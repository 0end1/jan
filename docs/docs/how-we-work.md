### Open Source

Jan is a startup with an open source business model. We believe in the need for an open source AI ecosystem, and are committed to building it.

- [Jan Framework](https://github.com/janhq/jan) (AGPLv3)
- [Jan Desktop Client & Local server](https://jan.ai) (AGPLv3, built on Jan Framework)
- [Nitro: run Local AI](https://github.com/janhq/nitro) (AGPLv3)

### Build in Public

We use GitHub to build in public and welcome anyone to join in.

- [Jan's Kanban](https://github.com/orgs/janhq/projects/5)
- [Jan's Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/janhq/projects/5/views/29)
- `coming soon` [Jan's Newsletter](https://newsletter.jan.ai)

### Remote Team

Jan has a fully-remote team. We are mainly based in the APAC timezone. We use [Discord](https://discord.gg/af6SaTdzpx) and [Github](https://github.com/janhq) to work.
