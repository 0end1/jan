## Saigon Hacker House 

Jan's Hacker House is a four-day offline event where the Jan team gathers at a hacker house prior to a major release. We use the time to work on the release, bond as a team and get Jan across the finish line. 

Jan hosts a series of talks, workshops and social events at night, inviting the local AI community to join us.
