## Ho Chi Minh City

[Jan's Hacker House](https://jan.ai) is a four-day offline event where the Jan team gathers at a hacker house prior to a major release. We use the time to work on the release, bond as a team and get Jan across the finish line. 

Jan hosts a series of talks, workshops and social events at night, inviting the local AI community to join us.

Jan is a fully remote team. We use the money we save from not having an office, to hold Hack Weeks where we eat pizza and work on Jan together before major releases.
