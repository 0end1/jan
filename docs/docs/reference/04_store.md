title: "store"
---

`store` is a helper object for working with Jan app's local storage database.

By default, Jan ships with a [pouchDB](https://pouchdb.com/) client side noSQL db to persist usage state.

_Note: default `store` logic is from [@data-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@janhq/data-plugin) which implements `StoreService`._

## Usage

```js
import { store } from "@janhq/core";
```
