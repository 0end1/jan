We use Github for 100% of our product / project management.

Projects are defined across the organization.

As much as possible, everyone owns their respective `epics`, `milestones`. and `tasks`.

> We aim for a `loosely coupled, but tightly aligned` autonomous PM culture.

## Projects

- `Projects` track large, long-term, & strategic initiatives that can span multiple teams and multiple sprints.
- Projects are listed in [Github Projects](https://github.com/janhq/jan/projects?query=is%3Aopen).
- `Projects` contain `epics`

## Epics && Milestones

`Epics`

- `Epics` are large user stories that are then further broken down into tasks.
- `Epics` track the specs, architecture decisions, designs, and what is in scope for large features.
- Every `epic` corresponds with a single `Milestones`
- `Epics` contain `tasks`
- `Epics` should only have 1 owner

`Milestones`

- `Milestones` correspond 1:1 to `epics`.
- We use `milestones` to render the correct Roadmap & Kanban views.
- `Milestones` should have a deadline.

## `Tasks`

- Tasks are individual features, bug fixes, or chores that can be completed within a few days
- Tasks under `In-progress` and `Todo` should always belong to a `milestone`
- Tasks are usually named per [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary)
- Tasks should only have 1 owner

We aim to always work on `tasks` that belong to a `milestones`.
