Add your own examples to this page by creating a new file in the `docs/docs/hardware/examples` directory. The file name should be the same as your username, followed by a dash, followed by the hardware form-factor. For example, `3090x1-%40dan-jan.md` would be the file name for a single 3090 GPU in a desktop form-factor.
