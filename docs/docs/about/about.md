---

Jan is a Personal AI that you can customize, that runs privately on your own computer. 

We envision a future where our lives are improved by helpful and practical AI assistants, that we continuously customize to meet our needs. 

## Why does Jan Exist?

### Our Mission

To enable high-productivity individuals to use AI to scale themselves. 

### Our Ideal Customer

Our ideal customer is an AI Enthusiast who wants to experiment with solving problems using AI, and is ok with experimental software. 

- Semi-technical (i.e. can code simple Javascript/Python scripts), i.e. not able to build the whole thing themselves
- Will file bugs
- [Plus] Wants to share their solution with others 

Our goal in 2023 is to find 500 of these ideal customers. 

### Problem Statement

Our ideal customer has clear ideas for how to solve his/her problems using AI, but has not done so because:

- Lack full skillset across UI, Backend and MLOps to build their own custom Personal AI
- Doesn't have 10 hours/week to build and maintain a Personal AI
- Uncomfortable with giving personal info to ChatGPT

### Our Solution

Jan is a Personal AI that you can customize, and runs privately on your own computer.

- Tinker and customize in <10 lines of code
- Pre-built plugins (e.g. RAG, Langchain, LlamaIndex)
- Mobile support (including helpful widgets)

Jan has a very modular architecture that allows you to swap out or customize components, without having to rebuild everything.
