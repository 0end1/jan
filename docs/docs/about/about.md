Jan is a [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source), [local-first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/) productivity tool to [create, customize and use AI](https://www.gatesnotes.com/AI-agents). 

You can: 
- Run locally using [open-source LLMs](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-generation) or connect to cloud AIs like [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api) or [Google](https://ai.google.dev/)
- Fine-tune AI with specific knowledge
- Search the web and other databases
- Connect AI to your everyday tools and (with your permission) do work on your behalf

Longer-term, Jan is building a cognitive framework for future robots. We envision a world where we have personal or company robots that we continually improve and customize, growing together with us.

## How do I get it?

## What license is the code under?

## What was it built with?





Jan is built on an open-source, modular framework 

 that runs on your own computer, with a local API server. It is a ChatGPT-alternative that is designed to be private, local, and free from subscription fees.



Jan believes in the need for an **open source AI ecosystem**. We are focused on building the infra and tooling to allow open source AIs to compete on a level playing field with proprietary ones.

Jan's long-term technical endeavor is to build a cognitive framework for future robots, who are practical, useful assistants for humans and businesses in everyday life.
