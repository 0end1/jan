This page explains all the architecture of [Jan.ai](https://jan.ai/).

## Synchronous architecture

### Overview

The architecture of the Jan.ai application is designed to provide a seamless experience for the users while also being modular and extensible.

### BackEnd and FrontEnd

**BackEnd:**

- The BackEnd serves as the brain of the application. It processes the information, performs computations, and manages the main logic of the system.

For easy to understand, this is like an [OS (Operating System)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) in the computer.
:::

**FrontEnd:**

- The FrontEnd is the interface that users interact with. It takes user inputs, displays results, and communicates with the BackEnd through Inter-process communication bi-directionally.

:::info
This is like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) application

**Inter-process communication:**

- A mechanism that allows the BackEnd and FrontEnd to communicate in real time. It ensures that data flows smoothly between the two, facilitating rapid response and dynamic updates.

### Plugins and Apps
**Plugins:**

In Jan, Plugins contains all the core features. They could be Core Plugins or [Nitro](https://github.com/janhq/nitro)

- **Load:** This denotes the initialization and activation of a plugin when the application starts or when a user activates it.

- **Implement:** This is where the main functionality of the plugin resides. Developers code the desired features and functionalities here. This is a "call to action" feature.

- **Dispose:** After the plugin's task is completed or deactivated, this function ensures that it releases any resources it uses, providing optimal performance and preventing memory leaks.

:::info
This is like [Extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode) in VSCode.

**Apps:**
 
Apps are basically Plugin-like. However, Apps can be built by users for their own purposes.

> For example, users can build a `Personal Document RAG App` to chat with specific documents or articles.

With **Plugins and Apps**, users can build a broader ecosystem surrounding Jan.ai.

## Asynchronous architecture

### Overview

The asynchronous architecture allows Jan to handle multiple operations simultaneously without waiting for one to complete before starting another. This results in a more efficient and responsive user experience. The provided diagram breaks down the primary components and their interactions.

### Components

#### Results

After processing certain tasks or upon specific triggers, the backend can broadcast the results. This could be a processed data set, a calculated result, or any other output that needs to be shared.

#### Events

Similar to broadcasting results but oriented explicitly towards events. This could include user actions, system events, or notifications that other components should be aware of.

- **Notify:**

Upon the conclusion of specific tasks or when particular triggers are activated, the system uses the Notify action to send out notifications from the **Results**. The Notify action is the conduit through which results are broadcasted asynchronously, whether they concern task completions, errors, updates, or any processed data set.

- **Listen:**

Here, the BackEnd actively waits for incoming data or events. It is geared towards capturing inputs from users or updates from plugins.

#### Plugins

These are modular components or extensions designed to enhance the application's functionalities. Each plugin possesses a "Listen" action, enabling it to stand by for requests emanating from user inputs.

### Flow

1. Input is provided by the user or an external source.
2. This input is broadcasted as an event into the **Broadcast event**.
3. The **BackEnd** processes the event. Depending on the event, it might interact with one or several Plugins.
4. Once processed, **Broadcast result** can be sent out asynchronously through multiple notifications via Notify action.
