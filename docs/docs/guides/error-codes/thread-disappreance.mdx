When you encounter the error of old threads suddenly disappear. This can happen when a new, unintentional file is created in `/jan/threads`.

It can be resolved through the following steps:

1. Go to `/jan/threads`.

2. The `/jan/threads` directory contains many folders named with the prefix `jan_` followed by an ID (e.g., `jan_123`). Look for any file not conforming to this naming pattern and remove it.
