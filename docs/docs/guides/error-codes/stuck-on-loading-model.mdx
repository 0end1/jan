## 1. Issue: Model Loading Stuck Due To Missing Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC)

Encountering a stuck-on-loading model issue in Jan is caused by errors related to the `Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC)` path not being included in the system's PATH environment variable.

Error message:
```
index.js:47 Uncaught (in promise) Error: Error invoking remote method 'invokeExtensionFunc': Error: Command failed: WMIC CPU Get NumberOfCores
```

It can be resolved through the following steps:

1. **Open System Properties:**
   - Press `Windows key + R`.
   - Type `sysdm.cpl` and press `Enter`.

2. **Access Environment Variables:**
   - Go to the "Advanced" tab.
   - Click the "Environment Variables" button.

3. **Edit System PATH:**
   - Under "System Variables" find and select `Path`.
   - Click "Edit."

4. **Add WMIC Path:**
   - Click "New" and enter `C:\Windows\System32\Wbem`.

5. **Save Changes:**
   - Click "OK" to close and save your changes.

6. **Verify Installation:**
   - Restart any command prompts or terminals.
   - Run `where wmic` to verify. Expected output: `C:\Windows\System32\wbem\WMIC.exe`.


## 2. Issue: Model Loading Stuck Due To CPU Without AVX

Encountering an issue with models stuck on loading in Jan can be due to the use of older generation CPUs that do not support Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX).

To check if your CPU supports AVX, visit the following link: [CPUs with AVX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions#CPUs_with_AVX)

:::warning [Please use this with caution]
As a workaround, consider using an [emulator](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/software-development-emulator.html) to simulate AVX support.
