By default, Jan uses GPU acceleration.

If you are experiencing this issue, you may need to download the latest Nvidia CUDA toolkit.

> We weren't propagating CUDA issues in the old build.

Steps:

1. Download Cuda toolkit (versions 11.4+) from [Nvidia](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Windows)

1. Go to Settings > Advanced > Turn on GPU acceleration

1. You may need to restart Jan

1. Check in `System Monitor` that there is more (V)RAM now

1. If the issue is not fixed, please install the [Nightly version](/install/nightly) instead.
