You may receive a "Error Occured: Failed to Fetch" response when you first start chatting with a selected model. 

This may occur due to several reasons. Please follow these steps to resolve it:

1. Ensure you are on the latest version of Mac, Windows or Ubuntu OS version
    - Upgrading to the latest version has resolved this issue for most people

2. Select a model that is smaller than 80% of your hardware V/RAM. 
    - For example, if I have a 8GB machine, I should select models smaller than 6GB.

3. Install the latest Nightly build from github linked in https://jan.ai/install/
    - If you are reinstalling Jan, follow the uninstall instructions for your relevant OS to clear the application cache

4.  Ensure your V/RAM is accessible by the application (some people have virtual RAM)
5.  If you are on Nvidia GPUs, please download [Cuda](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
