## Abstract

We present a straightforward approach to adapting small, open-source models for specialized use-cases, that can surpass GPT 3.5 performance with RAG. With it, we were able to get superior results on Q&A over [technical documentation](https://nitro.jan.ai/docs) describing a small [codebase](https://github.com/janhq/nitro).

In short, (1) extending a general foundation model like [](https://huggingface.co/jan-hq/stealth-v1.3)Mistral with strong math and coding, and (2) training it over a high-quality, synthetic dataset generated from the intended corpus, and (3) adding RAG capabilities, can lead to significant accuracy improvements.

Problems still arise with catastrophic forgetting in general tasks, commonly observed during continued fine-tuning [1]. In our case, this is likely exacerbated by our lack of access to Mistralâ€™s original training dataset and various compression techniques used in our approach to keep the model small.

## Selecting a strong foundation model

Mistral 7B continues to outshine [Meta's Llama-2 7B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b) and [Google's Gemma 7B](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-7b) on meaningful benchmarks, so we selected this as a starting point. 

Having a robust base model is critical. In our experiments, using Mistral as a starting point ensured the highest accuracy for subsequent specialized adaptations.

*Note: we are not sponsored by the Mistral team. Though many folks in their community do like to run Mistral locally using our desktop client - [Jan](https://jan.ai/).*

## Cost effectively improving the base model

Mistral alone has known, poor math capabilities, which we needed for our highly technical use case. Thus, we tested all model variants on top of Mistral, from foundation models to finetunes to model merges, in order to find a stronger base model to receive our own finetuning.

We found model merging to be a viable approach where each iteration is cost-effective + fast to deploy.

We ended up with [Stealth](https://huggingface.co/jan-hq/stealth-v1.3), a [SLERP](https://github.com/Digitous/LLM-SLERP-Merge) merge of Mistral with the following:

- [WizardMath](https://huggingface.co/WizardLM/WizardMath-7B-V1.1) for its math capabilities
- [WizardCoder](https://huggingface.co/WizardLM/WizardCoder-Python-7B-V1.0) for its coding capabilities
- Our own [Trinity](https://huggingface.co/jan-hq/trinity-v1.2) model for its versatility across general tasks

This particular combination yielded the best tradeoff across mathematical & technical reasoning while retaining the most pre-merge performance on general tasks.

## **DPO finetuning**

Merging different LLMs can lead to the mixed answering style because each model was originally trained on different types of data.

Thus, we applied Direct Preference Optimization ([DPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290)) using the [Intel's Orca DPO pairs](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Intel/orca_dpo_pairs) dataset, chosen for its helpful answering style in general, math and coding concentration.

This approach allowed us to have a final model, with minimal loss, and realign to our technical preferences.
